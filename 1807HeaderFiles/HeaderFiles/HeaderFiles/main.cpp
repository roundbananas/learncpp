//Angled brackets are used to tell the compiler that we are
//including a header file that was included with the compiler.
//Use the non .h version of a library if it exists, and access the functionality through the std namespace
#include <iostream>
//double-quotes tell the compiler that this is a header file we are supplying, so it should look for that header file in the current directory containing our source code first
#include "add.h" //forward declaration. The add.h file is COMPILED with main.cpp.

//note add.cpp, which contains the add function implementation, is LINKED with main.cpp because it has .cpp extension
